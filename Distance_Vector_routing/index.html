<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>In this assignment, you will write code to implement a distance vector routing protocol called RIP. 

</p><p>You can download the code of the assignment from <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~cs224m/routingpa/code.tar.gz">here</a>. You can unzip this code as follows:

</p><pre>$ tar -zxvf code.tar.gz 
./code/
./code/sampleoutput.txt
./code/sampleinput.txt
./code/routing_algo.cpp
./code/node.h
./code/main.cpp
</pre>

<p>As you can see above, the tarball has five files. You will only
need to edit the file <b>routing_algo.cpp</b>. You must node make
changes to node.h or main.cpp. The sample input and output files will
help you test your code. You can compile your code as follows to
create the 'rip' executable.

</p><pre>  g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp routing_algo.cpp -o rip
</pre>

The code is written to take input from standard input (terminal), so
you can redirect an input text file to standard input as follows, in
order to run the code.

<pre>./rip &lt; sampleinput.txt
</pre>

Below is a sample input file provided to you.

<pre>2 
3 
A B C 
A 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.21 B 
B 10.0.0.21 10.0.0.1 A 
B 10.0.1.23 10.0.1.3 C 
C 10.0.1.3 10.0.1.23 B 
EOE 
3 
A B C 
A 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.21 B 
B 10.0.1.23 10.0.1.3 C 
B 10.0.0.21 10.0.0.1 A 
C 10.0.1.3 10.0.1.23 B 
EOE
</pre>

<p>The first line is the number of input topologies (2 topologies,
both identical here, but that may not always be the case). The next
line defines the number of nodes in the network for this input
instance, followed by the labels for each node. Then, the next few
lines (until EOE is found) will consist of the assignment of an IP
address to each interface of the node along with the IP address of the
node to which it is connected to. Here, in the above example at line
#4, interface of A with an IP address 10.0.0.1 is connected to an
interface of B with IP address 10.0.0.21. The overall topology
represented by the above input is as follows.

<img src="index_files/sample1.png">

</p><p>The code in main.cpp parses the input and creates a data structure
of the list of the nodes in the network, along with information about
the interfaces at each node. It also initializes the routing table at
each node with entries of zero cost only to itself. All the relevant
datastructures are defined in node.h. Once the input has been parsed,
a call is made to the function 'routingAlgo', which is implemented in
the file routing_algo.cpp. You must complete this function so that it
correctly computes the routing table entries at all nodes. Once this
function returns, the main function prints the routing table before
moving on to the next set of inputs.

</p><p>The function 'routingAlgo' must run multiple iterations of the
Bellman Ford update algorithm at every node in the list of nodes, in
order to compute and update routing table entries. You must figure out
when the routing tables have converged and return from the function,
so that the routing tables can be printed out. During the execution of
the routingAlgo function, a node may wish to send its routing table
entries to other nodes. This is accomplished by calling the sendMsg()
function in the node's object. Calling sendMsg at a node will result
in a corresponding call to the recvMsg function at all its neighbors.
The sendMsg function is already implemented in node.h; you must
complete the recvMsg function in order to process a routing table
update from a neighbor at a given node.  

</p><p>The recvMsg function will run the Bellman Ford update algorithm of
the distance vector routing protocol, and update its routing table as
required. You will find the datastructures and functions implemented
in node.h useful; look over them carefully. In particular, the
function isMyInterface(string eth) returns true/false depending
whether the argument passed is the own interface of a node or not, and
will be helpful during your route computation algorithm.

</p><p>In summary, you will need to fill in the two functions: routingAlgo
and recvMsg in the file routing_algo.cpp. The function routingAlgo is
invoked by main, and should run the distance vector routing protocol
at all nodes in the network. This function should cause nodes to send
messages of their routing tables to their neighbors, who will
process these routing tables in recvMsg. The datastructures
corresponding to the messages exchanged are all defined in node.h.

</p><p>If you run the given version of the code, it will print only the 
default routing table entries at each node that point to itself. For 
example, your output for the given sampleinput.txt may initially look 
like this.

</p><pre>A:
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 0
B:
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 0
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 0
C:
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 0
A:
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 0
B:
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 0
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 0
C:
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 0
</pre>

If you implement the routing protocol correctly, the correct output
from your program when run against the above sample input (with two
similar topologies of three nodes each) should be as follows.

<pre>A: 
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 0 
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.1 | 1 
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.1 | 1 
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.1 | 2 
B: 
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 0 
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 0 
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.21 | 1 
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.23 | 1 
C: 
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 0 
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.3 | 1 
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.3 | 1 
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.3 | 2 
A: 
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 0 
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.1 | 1 
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.1 | 1 
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.1 | 2 
B: 
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 10.0.0.21 | 0 
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 0 
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.1 | 10.0.0.21 | 1 
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.23 | 1 
C: 
10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 10.0.1.3 | 0 
10.0.0.21 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.3 | 1 
10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.3 | 1 
10.0.0.1 | 10.0.1.23 | 10.0.1.3 | 2
</pre>

The output consists of the label of a node, followed by the routing 
table entries at that node, in the format {destination ip | next hop | 
my ethernet interface | hop count}. This output is printed out by the 
call to printTable() for each node at the end of main.cpp. Note that the
 function printTable sorts the routing table entries so that the output 
is deterministic for a given input, enabling autograding at our end.
 
<h3>Submission and Grading Instruction</h3>

the folder with your roll number and create tar.gz to submit this file 
on Moodle. The command for creating tar.gz from the folder is: tar -czvf
 <rollno>.tar.gz <folderpath>. Please follow the submission guidelines carefully.

<p>Note that we will test your code against many other topologies, not just the ones given in the sample input file.
