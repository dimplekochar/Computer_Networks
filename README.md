# Socket_Programming

The system I am developing is a simple key-value store. The client takes user input to get/put/delete keys and passes these requests over the server. The server maintains a data structure of key-value pairs in memory and returns a suitable reply to the server. When the request from the client is of the form "put key value", the server must store the key-value pair in its data structures, provided the key does not already exist. Put requests on an existing key must return an error message, "Key already exists." When the client sends a request of the form "get key value", the value stored against the key must be returned. If the key is not found, "Key not found" error message must be displayed. The client should be able to issue a delete request (on an existing key) as follows: "del key". For all requests that succeed, the server must either return the value (in case of get), or the string "OK" (in case of put/del). We assume that all keys and values are integers. When the user inputs "Bye", the server should reply "Goodbye" and close the client connection. Upon receiving this message from the server, our client program terminates.

The server must be able to communicate with multiple active clients at a time, this will require me to write my server either using event-driven I/O system calls (like select, epoll), or have multiple threads/processes, one for each client. Therefore, I decides to use epoll.
